# Contributing

The code for the project is handled via its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/justintadlock/breadcrumb-trail).  You can open tickets, create patches, and send pull requests there.

## Pull requests

Problem first.  Solution second.

Pull requests should have a ticket open for discussion first.  I rarely accept pull requests that aren't for a specific issue for various reasons.  It's far better to post an issue and let me or the community provide feedback prior to creating a pull request.

Please don't make pull requests against the `master` branch.  This is the latest, stable code.  You can make a pull request against one of the point branches or the `dev` (future release) branch.

## Coding standards

In general, the project follows all WordPress [coding standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards).  There are instances where it doesn't, opting for personal choices of my own, but in terms of contributing, following the WordPress standards is best practice.

## Script and style files

When making patches or pull requests with changes to script or style files, only do so to the primary file.  Don't create patches for the minified (`.min`) versions of the files.  Those will be minified after a patch is merged into the code base.

## Language

All text strings follow U.S. English by default.  While such guides are generally unneeded, in cases where style considerations are necessary, these will typically follow conventions laid out in *Elements of Style* or the *AP Stylebook*.

## Licensing

Any code contributed to the project via patches, pull requests, or other means will be licensed under the [GPL version 2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html) or later.  By contributing code to the project, you provide consent to use such code under this license.  The exception to this rule is when bringing in third-party code with an alternate open source license.

## Versioning

The project uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).  Version numbers will look like `3.2.1` where `3` is the "major" release, `2` is the minor release, and `1` is the patch release.
